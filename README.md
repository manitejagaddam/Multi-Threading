# 🚀 MultiThreading Code Hub

A curated collection of high-performance multithreaded C++ programs designed to tackle real-world problems with efficiency and concurrency in mind. This repository showcases practical use cases of `std::thread`, `std::mutex`, `std::atomic`, and more advanced synchronization mechanisms.

## 📂 Contents

- 🔢 **Prime Number Generator with Live Stop**  
  Efficient multithreaded prime generation with live termination support.

- 📊 **Sorting Algorithms Comparison**  
  Parallel execution of sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick) with benchmarking.

- 🔄 **Future Additions** *(Planned)*
  - Thread Pool implementation
  - Parallel matrix multiplication
  - Concurrent data structures (queues, stacks)
  - Parallel file processing

## 🧠 Why This Repository?

Most tutorials teach multithreading with toy examples — this repo is built for:
- 🔍 Real performance observation
- 💡 Intuition behind parallel execution
- 🛠️ Hands-on learning via code

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- C++17 or later
- g++ / clang++ with `-pthread` support
- Windows/Linux environment

---
